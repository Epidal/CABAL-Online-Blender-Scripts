This is a work-in-progress set of scripts for importing and exporting various file formats for the MMORPG `CABAL Online`.

`binary.py` contains functions to help with reading from binary files.  
`ebm_import.py` is an unfinished importer script from EBM files. Animations are still to be done.  
`loader.py` and `scripting.blend` are development files and aren't needed to use the scripts.
